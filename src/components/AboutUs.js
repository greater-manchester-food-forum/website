              As growing numbers of us are realising, food is vital in so many
              ways: not just in nourishing our bodies and communities, but as a
              means to vastly improve our collective environmental impact. It is
              also a key issue in achieving social justice through ensuring
              everyone can afford and access good-quality, healthy, desirable
              food.
              <br />
              <br />
              Cities are increasingly seen as a place where food systems can be
              changed, and Greater Manchester is no exception. The city has a
              wealth of organisations working on local food growing, food waste
              prevention, food access for those on low incomes, cooking and much
              more.
              <br />
              <br />
              The aim of this site, developed collaboratively by some of those
              organisations, is to bring many more people into a big
              conversation around food. It will be a hub to find out what is
              happening in the city, to link organisations who can share
              knowledge and resources, and to build a coalition of citizens
              demanding a better food future. We hope that the conversations
              happening here will shape what this online hub can do in future.
              <br />
              <br />
              Join the conversation and share your ideas!
