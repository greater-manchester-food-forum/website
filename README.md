* There is no server side to this application

## Run app locally 
To run the app locally, in development mode, run these commands whilst in the project root directory:

```npm install```

```npm run start```

*Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine.*

## Create a Production Build
Creating a production build will minify all of the required files and place them into the 'build' folder:

```npm run predeploy```

## Styling 
The site uses a CSS utility framework called [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind) which can be customised through the [tailwind.config.js](tailwind.config.js) file in the root directory. 

Changes to CSS files are automatically picked up and applied to the site through hot-reloading. 

The tailwind config file generates the [src/index.css](src/index.css) file which will get overwritten every time a change is detected (so don't edit this manually). 

There is comprehensive documentation available on their site. 

Alongside this, there are also some styles applied through the [src/styles/index.css](src/index.css) file, which is where any styles that aren't easily applicable with Tailwind should be placed.
